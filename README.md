# Neonfiy
A little program that allows to apply a bloom (neon) effect to pictures by using a 2D-OpenGL renderer

## Requirements
 - Windows 7 or up
 - GPU with OpenGL 3.1 (all current and not current GPUs has it)

## Getting Started
Just download the .zip file and extract it into a folder of your choice.

After starting the "Neonfiy.exe", you select the picture, you want to apply the effect to and press "Generate".
Now you should see your picture in a window and a configuration window.
Play with the configuration a bit until you like the result and press under "Picture Controls:" "Save" to save the picture.

If the window with the picture does something strange right after you selected a target, is everything fine. 
This is required to get the picture back into the original resolution.
